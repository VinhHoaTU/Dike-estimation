# ðŸš§ Context
Our study focuses on an industrial site, specifically a nuclear power plant, located near a river and protected by a levee whose optimal height needs to be determined. The site's proximity to the river poses a flood risk if the water level during a flood event exceeds the height of the protective levee.

# Approches
We will estimate the overflow height based on historical data and a hydraulic model, while incorporating economic constraints to determine the final optimal height.
